One of everyone's basic necessities is access to clean water for drinking. Legally speaking, having access to clean water for consumption is a fundamental human right. Water quality is influenced by a variety of factors and is one of the main topics of machine learning research. So, in this project I will try to understand how to analyze water quality using machine learning. The purpose behind this project is develop my analytics skills as well as practicing all the concept I have learned so far concerning Machine Learning and Data Science.
